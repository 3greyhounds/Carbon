# 0.2.1
  * Added IsJunction property to DirectoryInfo objects.  Returns true if a directory is a junction/reparse point.
  * Created a Carbon assembly for compiled code.  Moved P/Invoke functions from FileSystem.ps1 into assembly.  This is a backwards compatible change.
  * Created a Carbon.IO.JunctionPoint helper class for creating/removing/getting junction/reparse points.  Updated New-Junction and Remove-Junction to use the new helper class.
